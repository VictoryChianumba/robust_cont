### So, my hypothesis is that the blindspots observed in the robust_eeg experiment are generalisable. This means that the effects of perturbations to data as well as the implications are generalisable as well. 

I think that we should try this with vision models. As this would mean that perception for things like self driving could be vulnerable to attack. 

If this proves to be true, then we will move on to speech modes, where the implications are also dier.
